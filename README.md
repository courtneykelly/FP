Fundamentals of Computing II Final Project
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
For the final project, we built an interactive game called Save the Swine. The goal is to heard the wandering pigs to the safety of the barn before the wandering wolf eats them.

We used the C language to build this program using what we learned over the course of the entire semester.
